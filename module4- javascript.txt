=============================
MODULE: 4 (JavaScript Basic & DOM)

1) What is JavaScript?
-> JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages It is a text-based, lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted scripting programming language. This language is very popular for developing web pages. It can be used both on the client-side and server-side. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.

2) What is the use of isNaN function? 
-> The JavaScript isNaN() Function is used to check whether a given value is an illegal number or not. It returns true if the value is a NaN else returns false. It is different from the Number. isNaN() Method
isNaN( value )

3) What is negative Infinity? 
-> The negative infinity in JavaScript is a constant value that is used to represent a value that is the lowest available. This means that no other number is lesser than this value. It can be generated using a self-made function or by an arithmetic operation.JavaScript shows the NEGATIVE_INFINITY value as -Infinity.

4) Which company developed JavaScript? 
-> JavaScript was created at Netscape Communications by Brendan Eich in 1995. Netscape and Eich designed JavaScript as a scripting language for use with the company's flagship web browser, Netscape Navigator.

5) What are undeclared and undefined variables?
-> An undefined variable is one that has been declared but does not have a value. An undeclared variable is one that does not exist in the programmer at all.

6) Write the code for adding new elements dynamically? 
-> document.createElement("<tagName>");  
  Where <tagName> can be any HTML 
  tagName like div, ul, button, etc.
  newDiv element has been created
  For Eg: let newDiv = document.createElement("div");

7) What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?
-> ViewState and SessionState are used for client-side state management and server-side state management respectively. The basic difference between these two is that the ViewState is to manage state at the client’s end, making state management easy for end-user while SessionState manages state at the server’s end, making it easy to manage content from this end too.

8) What is === operator?
-> The strict equality (===) operator checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean result. Unlike the equality operator, the strict equality operator always considers operands of different types to be different.

9) How can the style/class of an element be changed? 
-> The class name is used as a selector in HTML which helps to give some value to the element attributes. The document.getElementById() method is used to return the element in the document with the “id” attribute and the “className” attribute can be used to change/append the class of the element.
syntax:
document.getElementById('myElement').className = "myclass";

(10) How to read and write a file using JavaScript?
-> readFile() and rs. writeFile() methods are used to read and write a file using javascript. The file is read using the fs. readFile() function, which is an inbuilt method.

(11) What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?
-> JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:
     •	for - loops through a block of code a number of times
     •	for/in - loops through the properties of an object
     •	for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
     •	while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
     •	do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

(12) How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?
-> In JavaScript parseInt() function is used to convert the passed-in string parameter or value to an integer value itself. This function returns an integer of the base which is specified in the second argument of the parseInt() function.

(13) What is the function of the delete operator?
-> The delete operator removes a property from an object.

(14)What are all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript?
->JavaScript has three kinds of popup boxes: Alert box, Confirm box, and Prompt box.

(15)What is the use of Void (0)?
-> JavaScript void 0 means returning undefined (void) as a primitive value. You might come across the term “JavaScript: void(0)” while going through HTML documents. It is used to prevent any side effects caused while inserting an expression into a web page.

(16)How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?
-> Approach: We can use a window. location property inside the script tag to forcefully load another page in Javascript. It is a reference to a Location object that is it represents the current location of the document. We can change the URL of a window by accessing it.

(17)What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?
-> Disadvantages of innerHTML
     •	Event handlers attached to any DOM element are preserved.
     •	Replacement is done everywhere.
     •	It is not possible to append innerHTML.
     •	Breaks the document.
     •	Used for Cross-site Scripting.
